            <h3>Reach tall and exhale forward, then bend knees enough to be able to place your palms on the floor, with head pressed against your legs. Be aware of your spine stretching in different directions as you pull your head down and in. For a deeper stretch, try to straighten the legs. Hold this pose for 6-8 breaths, then whilst inhaling, stretch arms outwards and raise them and your torso back to the standing position.</h3>
